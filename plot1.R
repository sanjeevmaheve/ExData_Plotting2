## PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): This file contains a data frame
## with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For 
## each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a 
## specific type of source for the entire year.
##
## Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds): 
## This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions
## table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.
##
## The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions 
## Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter 
## pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008.
##
## ASSUMPTION - 'Source_Classification_Code.rds' and 'summarySCC_PM25.rds'
## are available in current-working-directory.

## Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 
## 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the 
## total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 
## 2005, and 2008.

## remove (almost) everything in the working environment.
## You will get no warning, so don't do this unless you are really sure.

# The group_by() function is used to generate summary statistics 
# from the data frame within strata defined by a variable.
# The general operation here is a combination of splitting a data
# frame into separate pieces defined by a variable or group of 
# variables (group_by()), and then applying a summary function 
# across those subsets (summarize()).
